## üéØ The Challenge Addressed

Digital publishing faces urgent challenges:
1.  **Declining Attention:** Static formats struggle to retain user focus.
2.  **Limited Interaction:** Passive reading leads to superficial engagement.
3.  **Rigid Content:** A need for dynamic, AI-driven personalization.
4.  **The AI Opportunity:** How can AI reshape publishers' roles and create truly immersive experiences?

FluidContent AI is our answer to these challenges, aiming to create a future where content is a living, breathing entity.

## üí° Solution Overview

FluidContent AI processes original content alongside user profile data. An advanced AI assistant then performs several transformations:

1.  **Adapts the text** to be fluid and resonant.
2.  **Extracts key insights.**
3.  **Generates an interactive quiz.**
4.  Optionally suggests a new title and analyzes sentiment.

The output is a structured JSON for seamless integration into any digital platform, providing a richer, more engaging experience for the user and enhanced value for publishers and brands.

## üöÄ Running the Application
### üíª Local deploy

How to locally run the application.

**Prerequisites:**

*   Node.js v18+ (or your specified version) installed (for frontend)
*   Python v3.9+ (or your specified version) installed (for backend)
*   `pip` and `venv` (usually comes with Python)
*   Gemini API Key
*   ElevenLabs API Key
*   Git

**Installation & Setup:**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Gabbosaur/FluidContent-AI.git
    cd FluidContent-AI
    ```

2.  **Set up and run the Backend (Python):**
    *   Navigate to the backend directory:
        ```sh
        cd backend
        ```
    *   Create a virtual environment:
        ```sh
        python -m venv venv 
        # Or: python3 -m venv venv
        ```
    *   Activate the virtual environment:
        *   On Windows:
            ```sh
            .\venv\Scripts\activate
            ```
        *   On macOS/Linux:
            ```sh
            source venv/bin/activate
            ```
        *(You should see `(venv)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt)*
    *   Install backend dependencies:
        ```sh
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    *   Set up environment variables:
        Create a `.env` file and add your variables:
        ```
        GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
        ELABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key_here
        ```
    *   Run the backend server:
        ```sh
        uvicorn main:app
        # Default port is usually 8000 for uvicorn
        ```

3.  **Set up and run the Frontend (Node.js):**
    *   Navigate to the frontend directory (from the project root, if you were in `backend`):
        ```sh
        cd ../web-ui 
        ```
    *   Install frontend dependencies:
        ```sh
        npm install
        ```
    *   Set up environment variables
        ```
        VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
        ```
    *   Run the frontend development server:
        ```sh
        npm run dev
        ```

4.  **Check the Application:**
    Open your UI URL in your browser (e.g., [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) or the port specified by `npm run dev`).

### üê≥ Docker Deploy

## üåê Live Demo

Try it yourself: [fluid-content-ai.netlify.app](https://fluid-content-ai.netlify.app/)

You can create a new user or log in with one of the predefined test accounts:

- **chen@ai.com** / **TEST**
- **gabbo@ai.com** / **TEST**
- **mondadori@ai.com** / **TEST**

**‚öôÔ∏è Tech behind the scenes:**

- **Frontend**: hosted on **Netlify** (free tier)
- **Backend**: hosted on **Render** (free tier)

So yes, it's magic, but also **free-tier magic**.  
That means you *might* notice occasional delays, autosleep mode naps üò¥, or limits on data transfer üöß.  
Oh, and our servers are based in Europe, so depending on where you are, your data may be going on a little Eurotrip. ‚úàÔ∏èüá™üá∫
